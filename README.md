# SAP-ABAP---Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using SAP ABAP. It allows the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the system randomly selects an option as well. The result of the match is then displayed (win, lose, or draw).

## Features
1. User can choose from Rock, Paper, or Scissors using buttons.
2. The system randomly selects an option.
3. The result is displayed after every selection.
4. Simple ABAP coding practices are demonstrated, such as working with internal tables, random number generation, and selection screen events.
   
## Screens
Main Screen (Selection Screen): Allows the user to pick Rock, Paper, or Scissors via pushbuttons.
Output Screen: Displays the result of the game.

## How it works
- User's choice is captured via the pushbuttons.
- The system randomly picks one of the three choices.
- The result is determined based on the rules of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
- The result (win, lose, or draw) is displayed on the output screen.
